This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project based on sales and product data from Blinkit, a quick-commerce grocery delivery platform. The goal is to uncover insights into product performance, outlet efficiency, and customer behavior using visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs).

Key Objectives:
* Analyze total sales by fat content, item type, and store location
* Evaluate outlet performance based on size, location, and establishment year
* Clean and preprocess data for accurate analysis
* Visualize trends using donut charts, bar plots, stacked columns, and more
